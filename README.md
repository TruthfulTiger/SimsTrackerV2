# SimsTracker V2

This is a personal project that I am currently working on. It uses the Fat Free Framework (F3) for the PHP backend, and jQuery / Bootstrap for the frontend. It is a game helper, specifically for players of The Sims series (currently just 2) to keep track of their sims, and even keep score of a legacy challenge (more info at https://www.simslegacychallenge.com/legacy-challenge-rules/sims-2-legacy-challenge-rules-advanced/) .

We never covered F3 in uni, so this is completely self-taught. A lot of interactive pages have been written in jQuery (with the help of extra scripts where necessary); the whole thing has been great practice :)

The Sims 2 side regarding tracking is complete; I have recently fixed some glaring bugs but one or two minor ones may remain. However, I am working on a complete redesign of this site, so this is just up to showcase the code. A working repo for this will be up in due course.

It can be accessed at https://simstracker.pdasites.uk/

Because this is a personal project it is not currently well commented, but now people are showing an interest, I will work on that.
